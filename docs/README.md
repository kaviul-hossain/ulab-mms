This Docsify site is the GitHub Pages documentation entry point. It is intentionally lightweight, uses the live Docsify runtime, and keeps the docs easy to update without a build step.

## Deep Dive

The code-level documentation now lives in dedicated pages:

- [Architecture](architecture.md)
- [Authentication](auth.md)
- [Courses](courses.md)
- [Data Models](data-models.md)
- [Capstone](capstone.md)
- [Developer Notes](developer.md)

## Overview

The application centralizes marks entry, attendance tracking, capstone management, shared resources, and admin workflows in a single Next.js app.

It is organized around authenticated routes for students, admins, capstone reviewers, and course management tasks. MongoDB/Mongoose powers the persistent data layer, while NextAuth handles session-based access.

## What You Will Find Here

- Product overview and platform scope
- Route map for student and admin areas
- Setup and deployment notes
- Screenshots from the live application
- Maintenance references for the repository

## Screenshots

### Sign-in

The sign-in screen is the first entry point for most users.

### Dashboard

The dashboard is the main post-login workspace for academic and administrative tasks.

## Core Areas

### Authentication

The app includes sign-in, sign-up, forgot-password, and reset-password flows for general users, plus a separate admin sign-in route.

### Dashboard and Admin

The dashboard area exposes general operations, archived data, admin tools, and capstone management entry points.

### Marks and Courses

Course, exam, and mark data are stored in MongoDB and surfaced through course-specific routes and grading utilities.

### Attendance

Attendance flows support session creation and student check-in via session code.

### Capstone

Capstone routes are split by role and evaluation type, covering supervisor, evaluator, report, weekly journal, and peer-review workflows.

### Resources and Files

Resource browsing and file access are handled through dedicated routes for shared materials and personal file spaces.

## Route Map

- `/auth/signin`, `/auth/signup`, `/auth/forgot-password`, `/auth/reset-password`
- `/admin/signin`, `/admin/dashboard`, `/admin/settings`
- `/dashboard`, `/dashboard/admin-portal`, `/dashboard/capstone-portal`, `/dashboard/archived`
- `/attendance/checkin/[sessionCode]`
- `/course/[id]`, `/course/[id]/urms-grades`
- `/capstone`, `/capstone/supervisor`, `/capstone/evaluator`
- `/capstone/supervisor/[semester]/[category]/weekly-journal`
- `/capstone/supervisor/[semester]/[category]/peer`
- `/capstone/supervisor/[semester]/[category]/report`
- `/capstone/evaluator/[category]/report`
- `/project/[courseId]`
- `/resources/[[...folderPath]]`
- `/student/check-marks`

## Setup

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Set `MONGODB_URI` and any auth or email secrets required by your environment.
3. Run `npm run dev` for local development.
4. Open `/auth/signin` to test the login flow.

## Maintenance Notes

- Versioning is handled by a CI-based release flow rather than local git hooks.
- Database and index maintenance scripts live in the repository root and `scripts/` folder.
- Spreadsheet import/export and grading logic are centralized in utility modules.
- The deeper source walkthrough is split across the docs pages listed above.

## Deployment Notes

This site is intended to be published from the `docs/` folder on GitHub Pages.

Keep screenshots and other static assets inside `docs/assets/` so the site remains self-contained.
